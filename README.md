# My-Portfolio
##This project is to showcase samples of my work; it is a simple but classy portfolio. I aimed to make it fun and interactive.
###It features many clickable buttons and links, allowing for more than just viewing but also interactivity.
####We have an email me button that allows viewers/ clients to send an email directly by pressing the button. Next to it, we have social links that lead directly to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages.
#####The projects section features three of the works I have done, each image is clickable and will take the viewers to the website corresponding to the project.
#####Lastly, I have a contact section for viewers to get in touch with me.
